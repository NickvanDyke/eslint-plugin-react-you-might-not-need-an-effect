# ESLint - React - You Might Not Need An Effect

ESLint plugin to catch [unnecessary React `useEffect`s](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) to make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone. Highly recommended for new React developers as you learn its mental model, and even experienced developers may be surprised.

## üì¶ Installation

### NPM

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add -D eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Recommended

Add the plugin's recommended config to your ESLint configuration file.

#### Legacy config (`.eslintrc`)

```js
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:react-you-might-not-need-an-effect/legacy-recommended"
  ],
}
```

#### Flat config (`eslint.config.js`)

```js
import reactYouMightNotNeedAnEffect from "eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect";

export default [
  reactYouMightNotNeedAnEffect.configs.recommended
];
```

### Custom

If not using the recommended config, manually set your `languageOptions`:

```js
import globals from "globals";

// ...
{
  globals: {
    ...globals.browser,
  },
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaFeatures: {
      jsx: true,
    },
  },
};
```

### Suggested

The plugin can provide more accurate analysis when you pass the correct dependencies to your effects ‚Äî consider using [`react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks).

## üí¨ Feedback

The ways to (mis)use an effect in real-world code are practically endless! This plugin is not exhaustive, and minimizes false positives at the expense of occasional false negatives.
