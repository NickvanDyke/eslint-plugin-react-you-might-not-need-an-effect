# ESLint - React - You Might Not Need An Effect

ESLint plugin to catch [unnecessary React `useEffect`s](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) to make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone. Highly recommended for new React developers as you learn its mental model, and even experienced developers may be surprised.
